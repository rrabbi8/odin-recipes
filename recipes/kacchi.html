		In a large mixing bowl, marinate the mutton with yogurt, ginger-garlic

		powder, garam masala powder, and salt. Mix well and set aside for at
		least 2 hours.

		they turn golden brown.

	<li>
		Add the marinated mutton and cook for 10-15 minutes, stirring
		occasionally, until the meat is browned.
	</li>
	<li>
		Add 1-2 cups of water, cover the pot and let it cook on low heat for
		30-40 minutes, until the mutton is tender.

		cardamom pods, cloves, and bay leaf to the boiling water.

		evenly.
