<h1>Caramel Pudding</h1>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
	<li>1 cup sugar</li>
	<li>1/2 cup water</li>
	<li>4 eggs</li>
	<li>2 cups milk</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).</li>
	<li>
		In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat the sugar and water over medium heat,
		stirring until the sugar dissolves.
	</li>
	<li>
		Turn up the heat to high and continue to cook the sugar until it turns
		amber in color, about 5-7 minutes. Do not stir the sugar once it begins
		to boil.
	</li>
	<li>
		Pour the caramel into a 9-inch (23cm) baking dish and swirl to coat the
		bottom evenly. Set aside to cool.
	</li>
	<li>
		In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, and vanilla extract.
	</li>
	<li>
		Pour the egg mixture into the prepared baking dish over the caramel.
	</li>
	<li>
		Place the baking dish in a larger baking pan and fill it with water
		until it reaches halfway up the sides of the pudding dish.
	</li>
	<li>
		Bake in the preheated oven for 50-60 minutes, or until the pudding is
		set and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
	</li>
	<li>
		Remove the pudding from the oven and let it cool to room temperature.
	</li>
	<li>Refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight, before serving.</li>
	<li>
		To serve, run a knife around the edges of the pudding to loosen it from
		the dish.
	</li>
	<li>
		Place a serving dish upside down over the baking dish and carefully flip
		it over.
	</li>
	<li>
		The caramel sauce will flow over the pudding, creating a delicious
		glaze.
	</li>
	<li>Slice and serve chilled. Enjoy!</li>
